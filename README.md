# PublicPortfolio
Small sample of my work and descriptions of private content

In the coming days I hope to be uploading more of my work to Github, as part of my efforts to both find future opportunities as well as to publcily display what I have accomplished. I have code samples for everything on my resume, located at DylanMorganResume.docx.

However, some files will not be uploaded publicly. Many of these files either the instructor or an affiliated individual has requested that they are not distributed publicly, partially because some problems are reused year over year, and occasionally due to privacy concerns for certain individuals, I would follow two rules:

1. If anyone requests to see those code samples, they may message me on my LinkedIn account, a link to which is located in DylanMorganResume.docx, or submit a pull request. I will then discuss how to distribute that code to you. If you are a hiring manager or student at a university that does not use these prompts, I will likely have no objection to giving them to you.
2. If a student requests to see the code, I simply want evidence that this is unrelated to your current assignments. I'm perfectly fine with helping people, but I'm not going to give you the answers.

I hope to be also giving an outline of my past work to publicly show what I have done, even if the direct code for some of these is not immediately accessible.


#Projects

Data_Analysis - Work I've done with data analysis in Python and R. Items in this folder include:

Terrorism_Data
	This project began in a STAT 4210 class and was expanded upon afterwards. The data from the GTD (Global Terrorism Database) was anaylzed on the question of if there was a signfiicant difference in terror attacks before and after 9/11. The metrics used were fatalities per attack and the number of attacks. The simple conclusion is that there is a significant difference in both; terror attacks are less likely to occur, but when deadly attacks do occur, they take more lives than previously. However, when focusing on deadly terror attacks and removing any cases of unknown or isolated motivations, the number of fatalities is not signficiantly different. There is also no clear connection between the number of terror incients or fatalities in the United States and any organized group. Additionally, suicide attacks are far more common, and the terrorism situation between Europe and the United States is significantly differnent; European terror is far more organized, but still mostly conforms to separatist movements, whereas terror in the United States is more perpetrated by lone wolves and extremeists on the right and left (ie ELF and anti abortion activists).
Please note the dataset is not included with these files; you may access it by following the instructions on the GTD's website. If you wish to view it for academic purposes, it should be as simple as filling out a short form.
Terrorism_Data.pdf
	This is the original report I submitted for that class. It was the beginning of my journey with this dataset, but not the conclusion.
Terrorism_Data.R
	My R code of this basic analysis performed above. This includes both what is in the document above, some additional analysis, and some comments attempting to explain my thoughts.
