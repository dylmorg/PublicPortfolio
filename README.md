# PublicPortfolio
Small sample of my work and descriptions of private content

In the coming days I hope to be uploading more of my work to Github, as part of my efforts to both find future opportunities as well as to publcily display what I have accomplished. I have code samples for everything on my resume, located at DylanMorganResume.docx.

However, some files will not be uploaded publicly. Many of these files either the instructor or an affiliated individual has requested that they are not distributed publicly, partially because some problems are reused year over year, and occasionally due to privacy concerns for certain individuals, I would follow two rules:

1. If anyone requests to see those code samples, they may message me on my LinkedIn account, a link to which is located in DylanMorganResume.docx, or submit a pull request. I will then discuss how to distribute that code to you. If you are a hiring manager or student at a university that does not use these prompts, I will likely have no objection to giving them to you.
2. If a student requests to see the code, I simply want evidence that this is unrelated to your current assignments. I'm perfectly fine with helping people, but I'm not going to give you the answers.

I hope to be also giving an outline of my past work to publicly show what I have done, even if the direct code for some of these is not immediately accessible.
